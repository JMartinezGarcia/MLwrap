Description: A minimalistic library specifically designed to make the estimation of Machine
             Learning (ML) techniques as easy and accessible as possible, particularly within the framework
             of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process in data mining. The package provides
             all the essential tools needed to efficiently structure and execute each stage of a predictive
             or classification modeling workflow, aligning closely with the fundamental steps of the KDD
             methodology, from data selection and preparation, through model building and tuning, to the
             interpretation and evaluation of results using Sensitivity Analysis. The 'MLwrap' workflow is
             organized into four core steps; preprocessing(), build_model(), fine_tuning(), and
             sensitivity_analysis(). These steps correspond, respectively, to data preparation and
             transformation, model construction, hyperparameter optimization, and sensitivity analysis.
             The user can access comprehensive model evaluation results including fit assessment metrics,
             plots, predictions, and performance diagnostics for ML models implemented through Neural Networks,
             Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines algorithms. By streamlining these phases,
             'MLwrap' aims to simplify the implementation of ML techniques, allowing analysts and data
             scientists to focus on extracting actionable insights and meaningful patterns from large datasets,
             in line with the objectives of the KDD process.
