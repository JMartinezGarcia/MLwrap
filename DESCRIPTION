Description: TidyML is a minimalistic library specifically designed to make the estimation of Machine
             Learning (ML) techniques as easy and accessible as possible, particularly within the framework
             of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process in data mining. The package provides
             all the essential tools needed to efficiently structure and execute each stage of a predictive
             or classification modeling workflow, aligning closely with the fundamental steps of the KDD
             methodology, from data selection and preparation, through model building and tuning, to the
             interpretation and evaluation of results using Sensitivity Analysis. The TidyML workflow is
             organized into five core steps; preprocessing(), build_model(), fine_tuning(), show_results(),
             and sensitivity_analysis(). These steps correspond, respectively, to data preparation and
             transformation, model construction, hyperparameter optimization, results presentation, and
             sensitivity analysis. By streamlining these phases, TidyML aims to simplify the implementation
             of ML techniques, allowing analysts and data scientists to focus on extracting actionable insights
             and meaningful patterns from large datasets, in line with the objectives of the KDD process.
