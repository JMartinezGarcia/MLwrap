## Resubmission

This is a resubmission to optimize MLwrap 0.1.1.

In this version 0.2.0.:

Fine tuning algorithms have been optimized to reduce the
risk of overfitting.

Examples have been simplified and optimized to run faster,
avoiding expensive sensitivity methods; small grids
and light Random Forest configurations are used instead.
/Dontrun examples have been removed from the manual.
All examples execute successfully in a fresh session.
The text on some plots has changed size to accomadate datasets with many features.

R CMD check results

Local (Windows 11, R 4.5.0): 0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes,

Optional pretests:

Debian GCC (R-hub) clean, with the expected clock NOTE only.

Additional comments

Thank you for reviewing this resubmission to optimize MLwrap.
