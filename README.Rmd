# TidyML

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

TidyML is a minimalistic library specifically designed to make the estimation of Machine
Learning (ML) techniques as easy and accessible as possible, particularly within the framework
of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process in data mining. The package provides
all the essential tools needed to efficiently structure and execute each stage of a predictive
or classification modeling workflow, aligning closely with the fundamental steps of the KDD
methodology, from data selection and preparation, through model building and tuning, to the
interpretation and evaluation of results using Sensitivity Analysis. The TidyML workflow is
organized into five core steps; preprocessing(), build_model(), fine_tuning(), show_results(),
and sensitivity_analysis(). These steps correspond, respectively, to data preparation and
transformation, model construction, hyperparameter optimization, resuresults presentation, and
sensitivity analysis. By streamlining these phases, TidyML aims to simplify the implementation
of ML techniques, allowing analysts and data scientists to focus on extracting actionable insights
and meaningful patterns from large datasets, in line with the objectives of the KDD process.

## Installation

You can install the development version of TidyML from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("JMartinezGarcia/TidyML")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(TidyML)
## basic example code

formula_reg <- "psych_well ~ age + gender + socioec_status + emot_intel + depression"

analysis_object <- preprocessing(sim_data, formula_reg, task = "regression")

analysis_object <- TidyML::build_model(analysis_object, "Random Forest",
                                       hyperparameters = list(trees = 150))

analysis_object <- fine_tuning(analysis_object, "Bayesian Optimization", metrics = "rmse", plot_results = T)

analysis_object <- show_results(analysis_object, summary = T, scatter_residuals = T, scatter_predictions = T,
                                residuals_dist = T)

analysis_object <- sensitivity_analysis(analysis_object, methods = c("PFI", "SHAP"), 
                                        metric = "rsq")

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
